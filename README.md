# FE-Allocations-2019-2020
Data on FE funding allocations for 2019-2020

## Data sources

FE-Allocations-2019-2020.csv is the allocations tab extracted from the ODS file at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-allocation-data-2019-to-2020-academic-year.

LA-Political-Control-2019.csv is scraped from the Wikipedia page at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_make-up_of_local_councils_in_the_United_Kingdom (with minimal changes to align LA naming).

LA-Geography-2019.csv is taken from the data at https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/bbb0e58b0be64cc1a1460aa69e33678f_0?geometry=-8.629%2C50.184%2C3.637%2C51.399 (with minimal changes to align LA naming). Note that this file can not be trivially used with the other two because it provides data for Local Authority Districts, rather than for Local Authorities (and I don't have a mapping between the two).
