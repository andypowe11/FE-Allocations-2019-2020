# FE Funding Allocations 2019-2020
Data on FE funding allocations for 2019-2020

## Data sources

FE-Allocations-2019-2020.csv is the allocations tab extracted from the ODS file at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-allocation-data-2019-to-2020-academic-year.

LA-Political-Control-2019.csv is scraped from the Wikipedia page at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_make-up_of_local_councils_in_the_United_Kingdom (with minimal changes to align LA naming).

LA-Geography-2019.csv is taken from the data at https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/bbb0e58b0be64cc1a1460aa69e33678f_0?geometry=-8.629%2C50.184%2C3.637%2C51.399 (with minimal changes to align LA naming). Note that this file can not be trivially used with the other two because it provides data for Local Authority Districts, rather than for Local Authorities (and I don't have a mapping between the two).

16-19 Allocations for the 2019 to 2020 academic year

This publication includes allocation data for institutions funded by the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) for the 2019 to 2020 academic year.

You will find the following areas of provision and allocations included in this workbook:

- 16-19 mainstream funding in further education (FE)

- School sixth-forms including academies

- Student financial support

- Residential bursaries

- Residential support scheme

- Dance and drama awards (DaDA)

- Local authority student financial support funding

We provide funding for education and training for students up to the age of 19, or up to the age of 25 for those young people who have been issued an education, health and care (EHC) plan by their local authority. Students aged 19 to 25 with an EHC plan are reported alongside other students funded through the 16 to 19 budget. 19+ continuing learners are also included, as are a small number of non-formula funded institutions.

Students aged 16 to 19 undertaking an apprenticeship and most students aged 19 and over (other than those stated above) are not included here. Details of those allocations are published separately on gov.uk.

The 16-19 funding formula was significantly changed in the 2013 to 2014 academic year and so the figures published here are not comparable with similar publications preceding that year.

New for this year is the inclusion of advanced maths premium and alternative completions funding. More details of this funding is given on gov.uk

For further information on allocations, please refer to the funding guidance .

Here you will find relevant guidance documents such as the funding regulations and the funding rates and formula guidance.

The figures and institution details shown within this publication are as at 28 September 2019. Any changes after this date, including but not limited to schools becoming academies, contract variations, institution mergers, name/UPIN changes etc. will not be updated in this published version of the allocations.

The 2019 to 2020 academic year covers 1 September 2019 through 31 August 2020 for academies and 1 August 2019 through 31 July 2020 for all other institutions
